\title{Compute atmospheric pressure, function of altitude}
\usage{
w_atmp_alt(f_atmp, f_temp, alt)
}
\arguments{
\item{f_atmp}{File name of the known atmospheric pressure ts (mb)}

\item{f_temp}{File name of the air temperature at the known altitude (Â°C)}

\item{alt}{Altitude of the computed air- temperature ts (m)}
}
\value{
An hts file with the suffixe _<alt>
}
\description{
Compute atmospheric pressure, function of altitude
}
\details{
The function computes an atmospheric pressure time-series at a given altitude,
based on a known atmospheric pressure time-series at the sea level. It also needs
the air temperature time-series at the sea level for the same times.

In order to verify that both time-series correspond, it is strongly recommended to 
run previously the function \code{\link{h_common}}.
